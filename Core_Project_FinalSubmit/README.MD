# Dao Core Project Final Submission

Tested Backend locally with minimal (6 functions) to Graduate working great as required!

func submit_proposal() 
func vote ()
func get_proposal()
func get_all_proposals()

.....


Tested Frontend using bootcamp skeleton template working ok on --network ic


Combining both front and backend....ran out of cycles and time....

Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed while trying to register all canisters.
    Failed to create canister 'assets'.
      The Replica returned an error: code 5, message: "Canister 6wqfw-uyaaa-aaaag-qbleq-cai is out of cycles: requested 3_100_000_000_000 cycles but 
      the available balance is 490_151_766_356 cycles and the freezing threshold 1_160_772_780 cycles"


...running out of time as well so just submitting the Motoko backend and the minimal functions required to Graduate..


THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GUYS!!!!! 
Learnt a lot this week considering I am almost like a beginner....no stack :).
